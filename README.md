Numerous studies have explored the relationship between bacteria microbiome and cancer and have found that microbes could be used to discriminate and classify different cancer types as well as detect early stages of cancer in patients. However the association of fungal mycobiome with cancer has not been thoroughly explored before. Fungi have been found to interact heavily with bacteria by physical and biochemical mechanisms. Symbiotic, synergetic and antagonistic relationships occur between fungi, bacteria and the immune system, therefore it is imperative to explore the impacts of the mycobiome has on tumors. In this study, we perform a pan-cancer analysis on patientsâ€™ tissue, blood and plasma to characterize the mycobiome within multiple cancer types. We are applying statistical and machine learning analyses to detect and classify cancer-types and found that we are able to discriminate cancer-types based on the cancer-type-specific mycobiomes. Results of the analyses also displayed strong correlation between fungal diversity and abundance with occurrences of several cancer types suggesting permissive/supportive environments for tumor cells. This warrants further exploration of fungi in the world of cancer research.
